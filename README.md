# WoW_Fishing_Bot

### Description:
  A fishing bot for World of Warcraft that will automate casting, finding your bobber, and clicking the bobber when a fish is on.


### Setup:
  #### 1. Change WoW settings
  
  * Change to windowed mode.
      - I have found that windowed mode generally works better for whatever reason.
  * Lower graphics settings to 1
      - Finding the bobber works by filtering out parts of the video feed. The less clutter, the better.
  * Make sure liquid detail is set to 'Low'
      - Filtering works better when set to low as it tends to make the water surface more opaque (less clutter underwater).
